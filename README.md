# My configuration files

Uses GNU stow to manage config files.

Idea from [here](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/)

## Requirements

 - GNU Stow
 - This repo must be cloned one dir deep into home. Example: `~/.dotfiles`

## Usage

Use `stow <dir_name` to use individual configs.

Example: `stow nvim` to get all neovim configs.
